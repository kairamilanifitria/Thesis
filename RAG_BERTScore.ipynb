The scalar mixing technique allows the model to capture dependencies between distant positions in the input sequence by incorporating information from previous segments of the sequence.

Edge probing allows for the evaluation of different linguistic properties, such as part-of-speech, constituents, dependencies, entities, semantic role labeling, coreference, semantic proto-roles, and relation classification.

TextAttack is designed to build attacks using four components: a goal function, a set of constraints, a transformation, and a search method. The modular design of TextAttack allows researchers to easily construct attacks by combining novel and existing components. TextAttack provides implementations of 16 adversarial attacks from the literature and supports various models and datasets, including BERT and other transformers, and all GLUE tasks. In addition to attacks, TextAttack also includes data augmentation and adversarial training modules to improve model accuracy and robustness. The framework aims to democratize NLP by enabling anyone to try data augmentation and adversarial training on any model or dataset with just a few lines of code.\",\n",

It helped offset any potential upward pressure on prices that could have resulted from other factors. The decrease in energy prices played a significant role in keeping inflation in check, as energy costs are a major component of overall consumer prices. The impact of the decrease in energy prices on inflation was evident in the consumer price index, which increased by only 0.1% in November. The decline in energy prices also contributed to the core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increasing by 0.3% on the month. Overall, the decrease in energy prices helped to mitigate inflationary pressures and contributed to the stability of consumer prices.\",\n",

The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The 0.1% increase in the CPI suggests a modest rise in overall consumer prices. It is important to note that this increase is specific to the month of November and does not provide information about long-term trends in inflation. For a more comprehensive understanding of inflation, policymakers often focus on core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. The core CPI increased by 0.3% on the month, indicating a slightly higher rate of inflation when excluding these volatile components.\"]"

The report suggests that this increased demand has played a significant role in driving up copper prices.

        "              \"Decrease in Energy Prices and Inflation: The decrease in energy prices, specifically a 2.3% decrease, helped keep inflation in check. This was primarily driven by a 6% decrease in gasoline prices and a 2.7% decrease in fuel oil prices. The decline in energy prices contributed to overall inflation remaining relatively low. It helped offset any potential upward pressure on prices that could have resulted from other factors. The decrease in energy prices played a significant role in keeping inflation in check, as energy costs are a major component of overall consumer prices. The impact of the decrease in energy prices on inflation was evident in the consumer price index, which increased by only 0.1% in November. The decline in energy prices also contributed to the core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increasing by 0.3% on the month. Overall, the decrease in energy prices helped to mitigate inflationary pressures and contributed to the stability of consumer prices.\",\n",

This indicates a slight uptick in consumer prices during that month. The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The 0.1% increase in the CPI suggests a modest rise in overall consumer prices. It is important to note that this increase is specific to the month of November and does not provide information about long-term trends in inflation. For a more comprehensive understanding of inflation, policymakers often focus on core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. The core CPI increased by 0.3% on the month, indicating a slightly higher rate of inflation when excluding these volatile components.\",\n",
