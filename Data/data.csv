8;JOURNAL;2;Q3;what kind of model that introduced scalar mixing technique?;ELMo model;The scalar mixing technique was introduced by the ELMo model.;The model that introduced the scalar mixing technique is the Transformer-XL model. Transformer-XL is a variant of the Transformer model that addresses the limitation of the original Transformer's fixed-length context window. The scalar mixing technique is introduced in the context of modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. The scalar mixing technique allows the model to capture dependencies between distant positions in the input sequence by incorporating information from previous segments of the sequence. This technique involves using a set of learned scalars to combine the hidden states from different segments of the input sequence. By incorporating the scalar mixing technique, Transformer-XL achieves improved performance in tasks that require modeling long-range dependencies, such as language modeling and machine translation.;1;0
9;JOURNAL;2;Q4;what language model used in this paper?;BERT model;"The language model used in this paper is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), as mentioned in the text: ""We build on this latter line of work, focusing on the BERT model (Devlin et al., 2018).""";The language model used in this paper is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT is a deep language model that has shown state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. BERT is based on the Transformer architecture and is trained with a multi-task objective, including masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction.

10;JOURNAL;2;Q5;What is the main purpose of edge probing?;"to measure how well information
about linguistic structure can be extracted
from a pre-trained encoder";The main purpose of the edge probing task suite is to explore how the different layers of the BERT network can resolve syntactic and semantic structure within a sentence. It aims to measure how well the BERT network can extract information about linguistic structure and how it represents language.;The main purpose of edge probing is to measure how well a pre-trained encoder can extract information about linguistic structure. Edge probing decomposes structured-prediction tasks into a common format, where a probing classifier receives spans and must predict a label such as a constituent or relation type. The probing classifier has access only to the per-token contextual vectors within the target spans, relying on the encoder to provide information about the relation between these spans and their role in the sentence. Edge probing allows for the evaluation of different linguistic properties, such as part-of-speech, constituents, dependencies, entities, semantic role labeling, coreference, semantic proto-roles, and relation classification. The edge probing approach provides insights into the capabilities of pre-trained encoders in capturing linguistic structure and helps in understanding the decision-making process of the model. ;1;1

36;NEWS;3;Q1;what caused the highest chance for impactful snow this winter on the East Coast?;active Pacific storm track typical of an El Niño winter will send a series of storms across the US into next week;The highest chance for impactful snow on the East Coast this winter is caused by an active Pacific storm track that is typical of an El Niño winter. This storm track is sending a series of storms across the US, presenting the highest chance for impactful snow so far this winter in some of the country's most populous areas on the East Coast.;The highest chance for impactful snow this winter on the East Coast was caused by an active Pacific storm track typical of an El Nino winter, which sent a series of storms across the US. These storms crossed the southern half of the US before moving up the East Coast, presenting the highest chance for impactful snow in some of the country's most populous areas. The storm system brought heavy precipitation, and the key question was where it would fall as snow and where it would fall as rain, especially along the highly populated I-95 corridor from Washington, DC, to Boston. If even an inch of snow were to fall in this corridor, it would end significant snowless streaks for major cities that have lasted for nearly two years. The storm system was expected to bring significant snow to higher elevation areas of the Appalachians and the interior Northeast, including central Pennsylvania.;1;1
37;NEWS;3;Q2;when does rain predicted will begin in eastern Texas?;Thursday evening;Rain will begin Thursday evening in eastern Texas.;Rain is predicted to begin in eastern Texas on Thursday evening, according to the provided context. The rain is expected to progress with the storm's track to the east, overrunning the Southeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic with time. This storm system could cause flooding issues in the South, particularly in areas that have already experienced heavy rainfall earlier in the week. The exact track of the storm becomes less certain after it leaves the Southeast, but heavy precipitation is expected to spread across the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and possibly the Northeast over the coming weekend.

Specifically, gasoline prices fell by 6% and fuel oil prices were down by 2.7%. This decline in energy prices contributed to lower overall inflation as it offset some of the price increases in other categories.;Decrease in Energy Prices and Inflation: The decrease in energy prices, specifically a 2.3% decrease, helped keep inflation in check. This was primarily driven by a 6% decrease in gasoline prices and a 2.7% decrease in fuel oil prices. The decline in energy prices contributed to overall inflation remaining relatively low. It helped offset any potential upward pressure on prices that could have resulted from other factors. The decrease in energy prices played a significant role in keeping inflation in check, as energy costs are a major component of overall consumer prices. The impact of the decrease in energy prices on inflation was evident in the consumer price index, which increased by only 0.1% in November. The decline in energy prices also contributed to the core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increasing by 0.3% on the month.

The disruptions in mining supply and the increasing demand are both fueled by the push for renewable energy. Additionally, the likely decline in the U.S. dollar in the second half of 2024 is also expected to contribute to the increase in copper prices.;According to a report by BMI, a Fitch Solutions research unit, the following factors caused copper prices to rise: Mining supply disruptions: The report highlights that mining supply disruptions have contributed to the increase in copper prices. Higher demand driven by the green energy transition: The push for renewable energy has led to a rise in demand for copper, as it is a key component in renewable energy infrastructure. The report suggests that this increased demand has played a significant role in driving up copper prices. Decline in the U.S. dollar strength: The report predicts a likely decline in the strength of the U.S. dollar in the second half of 2024. A weaker U.S. dollar makes copper, priced in greenbacks, more attractive to foreign buyers, further supporting the increase in copper prices.
